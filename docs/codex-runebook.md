## Product Development

Are you an entrepreneur that would like to delve into the world of consumer products?  
Do you want to pursue a project outside of your core business?  
Are you a start-up with an idea but need direction?

Innovation is what drives our society. However, with increased public attention placed on product safety, government regulations are increasing drastically and this makes new product development almost unattainable for many entrepreneurs, both as it pertains to financial requirements as well as general knowledge of the process. [BioChroma Analytical Labs](http://biochromalabs.com/about.html) has a mission to share our knowledge, expertise and industry connections with innovators without breaking the bank!

We have a developed a system that can help make that idea come to fruition. [BioChroma Analytical Labs](http://biochromalabs.com/about.html) has experienced scientists on staff as well as a developed network with many great contract manufacturers, packagers, brokers and logistic teams to move your project from concept to market. We can assist as much or as little as needed during the core stages of product development.

## Analytical Laboratory

**BioChroma Analytical** sets itself above all other service facilities by providing multiple service offerings. In addition to the one shop stop, BioChroma Analytical sets the bar for customer service. Our Business attitude is Service first. Use us as your own scientific group to guide you through difficult decisions about testing and how it relates to quality of your product. We are here to educate and help you fully understand what you should test and why!

There is a growing need to instruct and guide prospects on proper methods of testing and interpretation of results. Different regulatory agencies recommend, and sometimes require, different analytical methods. BioChroma Analytical Labs has scientists with years of experience on selection of test methodology and they are here to guide clients through understanding how the results impact their product and business.

BioChroma Analytical Laboratories provides high-level analytical and R&D service in the following categories:

### Microbiological
These tests follow compendia methods such as [USP](http://www.usp.org/), [AOAC](http://www.aoac.org/), [FDA](http://www.fda.gov/) BAM and [USDA](http://www.usda.gov/).
-   Shelf Life Studies
-   Microbial Quality Analysis (quantitative)
-   Pathogenic Bacteria Analysis
-   Preservative Efficacy
-   Endotoxin
-   Water Suitability
-   Microbial ID
-   Microscopic Examination
-   Environmental Monitoring (sampling supplies provided by BioChroma Analytical Labs)

---

### Chemical
These tests follow compendia methods such as [USP](http://www.usp.org/), [AOAC](http://www.aoac.org/), [FDA](http://www.fda.gov/) BAM and [USDA](http://www.usda.gov/).
-   Raw Material Identification
-   Wet Chemical Techniques (Moisture, pH, titrations, etc.)
-   Active Ingredient Assay
-   Nutritional Analysis
-   Allergen
-   Toxin
-   Pesticide

-   Stress
-   Forced Degradation

---

### Consulting
This service provides our customer’s assistance with all aspects of manufacturing.
-   **Ingredient Stability & Product Formulation Advice**
    Not all ingredients are stable and there are many conditions that affect stability including pH, temperatures required for proper processing and exposure to light. To create a product with appeal, good efficacy (if so desired) and remaining in the same condition from the time it was manufactured until the expiration date requires knowledge and experience with the ingredients.

-   **Packaging & Container Closure Advice**
    The content of a formula dictates the types of packaging and closures to be used. This is not a decision to be taken lightly because it can affect the shelf life and aesthetics of the product.

-   **Contract Manufacturer Plant Selection/Inspections**
    For anyone new to the world of manufacturing, selecting a contract manufacturer will likely be a major task. We can help provide assurance that you are selecting the perfect fit for your product.

-   **Quality and Regulatory Advice**
    The Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) is the document provided by the Executive Branch of the US Federal government which provides rules that govern our industry. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has the legal authority to regulate this law. Once a product is ready to hit the store shelves is not the time to start becoming familiar with this entire process. It can be very overwhelming and discouraging but there is no reason to let it derail new and unique product ideas. Take it in stride and start implementation of quality during the early stages of development. We are here to help with establishing a quality program and provide advice on label do's and don’ts.

---

### Laboratory Studies
These studies are not part of regulatory GMPs. Methods in this category are to demonstrate the function of a product.
-   In vitro Bioavailability
-   Skin Permeability
-   Enzyme Assays
-   Inhibition Assays
-   Antibiotic Efficacy
-   Microbial Kill Studies
-   New Method Development to Fit Customer Needs

END CANONICAL SOURCE CONTENT

---

### Non-negotiables
- One task per run; include acceptance criteria.
- Every accepted change must pass: `npm run build`.
- Home page must have one hero and one H1.
- Mobile-first: no overflow, no broken buttons, no weird spacing.
- Avoid tall “Steps/Process” sections; any process content must be compact (fits one screen; preferably one row).
- Minimal client JS; prefer static rendering.

### Brand constraints
Primary colors:
- Green `#4db848`
- Blue `#264177`

Complementary colors are allowed, but keep the overall style cohesive and modern.

### Tone / compliance constraints
- Professional, conservative, compliance-safe. No hype (“best”, “guaranteed”, etc.).
- Do not imply medical outcomes.
- If a claim is not supported in the source text, do not add it.

### Required missing information to add (customer expectations)
Add these as compact sections within existing pages (Home, Services, or Contact). Do not introduce new top-level pages unless explicitly instructed.

The original copy lacks key customer-facing operational info. Add these sections (short and factual), without inventing specifics:

- **How to Start / Sample Submission (high-level)**  
  Provide a simple engagement flow (contact → quote → sample submission → testing → report).  
  Do not invent sample amounts, temperatures, or turnaround times unless provided elsewhere.

- **Accreditation & Quality (high-level)**  
  Explain what ISO 17025 means in plain language.  
  Do not list accrediting body/certificate numbers unless provided.

- **What We Test (scannable summary)**  
  Convert the existing service lists into clear scannable groupings, tied to common matrices (food, supplements, cosmetics, OTC, etc.) only if supported by the source.

- **Contact CTA clarity**  
  Ensure contact pathways are obvious and repeated, using existing phone/email from the source.

### Known cleanup items from source text
- Remove outdated “COVID-19 Update” content (replace with evergreen operations copy) unless explicitly requested to keep.
- Remove corrupted/junk string present in source content (e.g., `wvr&W2^cYB4aq5QgdDHb`).

### Implementation guardrails
- No layout redesign until content replacement and required missing sections are integrated.
- Prefer improving hierarchy, spacing, and components without changing overall structure drastically.
- Accessibility: semantic headings, correct H1/H2 order, keyboard-friendly buttons/links.
